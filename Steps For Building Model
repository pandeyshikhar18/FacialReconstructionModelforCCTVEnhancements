Step 1: Extracting Frames from MP4 Files(535 frames from each video)
Loop through each folder containing MP4 files.
For each MP4 file, extract approximately 535 frames.
Save the extracted frames as images in separate folders, naming each frame sequentially (e.g., frame_001.jpg, frame_002.jpg).

Step 2: Cropping Faces from Frames
Load each saved frame.
Use a face detection algorithm (like OpenCV’s Haar Cascades or Dlib’s face detector) to detect faces in the frames.
Crop the detected faces from the frames.
Save the cropped faces into a separate folder for each video, organized similarly to the extracted frames.

Step 3: Enhancing Cropped Faces
Load each cropped face image.
Apply image enhancement techniques such as super-resolution, deblurring, and noise reduction to improve clarity.
Save the enhanced images into a separate folder (e.g., enhanced_faces), ensuring the naming corresponds to the original cropped face images.

Step 4: Loading and Comparing Faces
Load the first 6 images from both the cropped face folder and the enhanced face folder.
Display the original and enhanced images side-by-side for comparison.
Showcase the improvement in visual quality.
